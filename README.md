# Parallel-MultiRadial-Method

Preliminary package for implementing parallel-MRM algorithm based on the paper "Scalable Projection-Free Optimization Methods via MultiRadial Duality Theory" by Ben Grimmer and Thabo Samakhoana.

With the right packages installed, convergence_experiments.ipynb will re-produce the real-time and per-iteration plots in that paper. Similarly, multi_center_experiments will re-produce the scatter plots in the paper.

Disclaimer! All the code in this project is for demonstrative purposes only, it is neither optimized for speed nor memory.
